The corpus I used is the music from a DJ set I made previously, mainly include deep/ambient techno music. I categorized the music tracks based on the color scheme of the album cover. I first used two corpus of pink and black album. From this graph we can see that there is a noticeble different in energy level between the two groups. I find it interesting that sometimes music can be describe in color and I would like to discover more on the connection between music and color.
